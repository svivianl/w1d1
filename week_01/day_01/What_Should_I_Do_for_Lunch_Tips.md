### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operations ('<', '>', '===', etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch usuing the 'node' command in Vagrant.

Work in your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use 'hungry' and 'availableTime' inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

`function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}`
